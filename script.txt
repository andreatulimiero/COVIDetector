Hello, and welcome to the presentation of COVIDetector: A secure, anonymized platform to prescreen for illness using machine learning.

# Slide 1
Using just audio samples gathered by users over time, we hope that our machine learning model is able to train to classify patients on whether or not they will become sick in the upcoming days.

# Slide 2
Patients anonymity is paramount, hence we realized an anonymous registration process which allows the users to upload their samples in complete anonymity -- not even us can relate the email addresses needed to create an account to the samples created.

# Slide 3
The front end conveniently allows users to upload their voice samples over a period of time.
We believe that analyzing the evolution of a patient's condition might allow for a better prediction of the likelihood of being sick, compared to single one shot samples.

# Slide 4
After collecting enough data, the machine learning model will train on it.
After data is collected and training is completed, the model will be ready to start classifying whether or not patients show signs of a disease.

# Slide 5
We hope for this project to be as much use to the public as possible.
First, all our source code and models are open-sourced.
Second, for users that consent to doing so, their data will be made available for the public (again remain completely anonymized), so that other research projects can take advantage of the data to build up on our work.
